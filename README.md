It is like our mobile phone's telephone application which is used to manage contacts. 
Here, I took some operations to add, delete, search, edit and display contacts using switch cases and files concepts in Dev C++ using c language.. 
void add() - It is used to add new contact. 
void remov() - It is used to remove the contact if it is existing. 
void search() - It is used to search for the contact to check whether it is existing or not, if existing then we can retrieve it. 
void edit() - It is used to modify the existing contact. 
void display() - It is used to show the contacts which are there and displays the total number of contacts are existing.
